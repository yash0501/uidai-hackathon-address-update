## Description (How it works??):

- The problem statement is to update the address of the user in the Urban Areas.
- The borrower will send the request for his address to the landlord using his Aadhaar VID.
- The Landlord will receive the request in the form of message on his registered mobile number.
- He will then consent the request and his address details will be sent over to borrower.
- The borrower will be having the option to partially edit the address keeping it in the range of the locality.
- If the updated address lies outside that zone, the request will be terminated.
- The borrower should be present on the address so that his GPS will be used to verify the address.
- The Landlord will be able to verify the address by using the GPS of the borrower.
- The Landlord will be able to verify the address by using the Aadhaar VID of the borrower.
- Once verified, the borrower will be able to update the address.
